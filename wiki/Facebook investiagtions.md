# Detect Fake Facebook Profiles 

- Check the join date 


Make sure the joining date is old and has related posts like the first post and look at the relative posts, make sure they are recent

- There are no posts or photos and other content 

First, look at the detailed account information. If the average number of posts is few and most of them are private or only friends, try to interact with the target by profiling the account

- Persons age does not accord with the profile content 

Look at posts and photos and what is shared there according to age

- There are no friends who have the same surname 

There is no list of friendships such as close friends, family related to the target or things the target is interested in

- Friend lists whose profiles are fake 

Check the friend list, whether the account has the same indicators or patterns as the points explained here. You can see and investigate your friendship list from photos, posts and look for other sources, whether from purchased or fake accounts

- Use of stock image for profiles 

You can do a reverse image search to determine where the photo came from. If you find this photo circulating a lot on the internet and a little information on the internet, you can be sure that it is fake or generated by AI or editing skill 

- Profile picture do not show face or clear image 

There are no related facial photos and the photos in the album are not clear, such as blurry, depicting logos or cartoon photos and other things

- Friend lists are different culture, location and language 

- Too few friends or to many friend list 

The account is still quiet or has too many friends. It is possible that a new account was created or the account has been created several times for a specific purpose and is not consistent with the bio and profile linked to the friends list. Try to chat or interact with your friends list, if there is no response and the chat is like a robot reply, you don't follow the fanpage then it's definitely fake

- Profile name is different to the profile name as in the url 

- The like post, photo are on single topic 

- Bio inconistencies
